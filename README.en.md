### Other Function Examples
[Video Demonstration](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zH4y1h7Y9/)

## ❓How to get started?

Here I am using Postgres as the data and vector storage because Semantic Kernel and Kernel Memory support it, but you can also use other options.

The model by default supports the local model of openai, azure openai, and llama. If you need to use other models, you can integrate them using one-api.

The Login configuration in the configuration file is the default login account and password.

The following configuration file needs to be configured

## 1️⃣Using docker-compose

Provided the pg version **appsettings.json** and simplified version (Sqlite+disk) **docker-compose.simple.yml**

Download **docker-compose.yml** from the project root directory and place the configuration file **appsettings.json** in the same directory.

The pg image has already been prepared. You can modify the default username and password in docker-compose.yml, and then the database connection in your **appsettings.json** needs to be consistent.

Then you can execute the following command in the directory to start AntSK
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## 2️⃣How to mount local models and model download directory in docker
```
# Non-host version, do not use local proxy
version: '3.8'
services:
  antsk:
    container_name: antsk
    image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/AIDotNet/antsk:v0.6.3
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    networks:
      - antsk
    depends_on:
      - antskpg
    restart: always
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://*:5000
    volumes:
      - ./appsettings.json:/app/appsettings.json # Local configuration file needs to be placed in the same directory
      - D://model:/app/model
networks:
  antsk:
    external: true
```
Taking this as an example, it means mounting the local D://model folder of Windows into the container /app/model. If so, the model address in your appsettings.json should be configured as

[LiteDockerCompose](https://github.com/AIDotNet/AntSK/blob/main/docker-compose.simple.yml)

The compact version is deployed with sqlite-disk by one click

[FullDockerCompose](https://github.com/AIDotNet/AntSK/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

The full version uses pg+aspire


## 3️⃣Some meanings of configuration file
```
{
  "DBConnection": {
    "DbType": "Sqlite",
    "ConnectionStrings": "Data Source=AntSK.db;"
  },
  "KernelMemory": {
    "VectorDb": "Disk",
    "ConnectionString": "Host=;Port=;Database=antsk;Username=;Password=",
    "TableNamePrefix": "km-"
  },
  "FileDir": {
    "DirectoryPath": "D:\\git\\AntBlazor\\model"

    "User": "<your-account>",
    "Password": "<your-strong-password>"
  },
  "BackgroundTaskBroker": {
    "ImportKMSTask": {
      "WorkerCount": 1 
    }
  }
}
```

// Supports various databases, you can check SqlSugar, MySql, SqlServer, Sqlite, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Dm, Kdbndp, Oscar, MySqlConnector, Access, OpenGauss, QuestDB, HG, ClickHouse, GBase, Odbc, OceanBaseForOracle, TDengine, GaussDB, OceanBase, Tidb, Vastbase, PolarDB, Custom
DBConnection.DbType

// Connection string, need to use the corresponding string according to the different DB types
DBConnection.ConnectionStrings

//The type of vector storage, supporting Postgres, Disk, Memory, Qdrant, Redis, AzureAISearch
//Postgres and Redis require ConnectionString configuration
//The ConnectionString of Qdrant and AzureAISearch uses Endpoint | APIKey
KernelMemory.VectorDb

//Local model path, used for quick selection of models under llama, as well as saving downloaded models.
FileDir.DirectoryPath

//Login credentials: set a strong password in production; prefer injecting via env vars Login__User / Login__Password
Login

//Import asynchronous processing thread count. A higher count can be used for online API, but for local models, 1 is recommended to avoid memory overflow issues.
BackgroundTaskBroker.ImportKMSTask.WorkerCount

```

## ⚠️Fixing Style Issues:
Run the following in AntSK/src/AntSK:
```
dotnet clean
dotnet build
dotnet publish "AntSK.csproj"
```
Then navigate to AntSK/src/AntSK/bin/Release/net8.0/publish and run:
```
dotnet AntSK.dll
```
The styles should now be applied after starting.

I'm using CodeFirst mode for the database, so as long as the database connection is properly configured, the table structure will be created automatically.

## ✔️Using llamafactory
```
1. First, ensure that Python and pip are installed in your environment. This step is not necessary if using an image, such as version v0.2.3.2, which already includes the complete Python environment.
2. Go to the model add page and select llamafactory.
3. Click "Initialize" to check whether the 'pip install' environment setup is complete.
4. Choose a model that you like.
5. Click "Start" to begin downloading the model from the tower. This may involve a somewhat lengthy wait.
6. After the model has finished downloading, enter http://localhost:8000/ in the request address. The default port is 8000.
7. Click "Save" and start chatting.
8. Many people ask about the difference between LLamaSharp and llamafactory. In fact, LLamaSharp is a .NET implementation of llama.cpp, but only supports local gguf models, while llamafactory supports a wider variety of models and uses Python implementation. The main difference lies here. Additionally, llamafactory has the ability to fine-tune models, which is an area we will focus on integrating in the future.
